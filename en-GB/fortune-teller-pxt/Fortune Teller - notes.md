title: Fortune Teller â€” Notes for Club Leaders
---

#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to make use of selection, by making a 'fortune teller'. The fortune teller will work like a magic 8-ball, and will give the user the answer to a question they ask the micro:bit.

#Resources
For this project, the [Code Kingdoms](http://jumpto.cc/mb-new) microbit editor should be used.

You can find a completed version of this project at [pxt.microbit.org/#pub:18828-96734-17356-00995](https://pxt.microbit.org/#pub:18828-96734-17356-00995), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

#Learning Objectives
+ Selection `if` blocks;
+ The `random` block.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

#Challenges
+ "Multiple answers" - Consolidating use of `if` blocks, by adding 'No' and 'Ask again' answers.
+ "Shake your micro:bit" - Shake the micro:bit instead of pressing a button.
