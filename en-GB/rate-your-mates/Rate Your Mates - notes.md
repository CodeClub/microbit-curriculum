title: Rate Your Mates â€” Notes for Club Leaders
---

#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to make use of variables and random numbers by making a compatibility program. Two users will each press a button on the micro:bit, which will then tell them their compatibility percentage.

#Resources
For this project, the [Code Kingdoms](http://jumpto.cc/mb-new) microbit editor should be used.

You can find a completed version of this project at [microbit.co.uk/tewqjx](https://www.microbit.co.uk/tewqjx), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

#Learning Objectives
+ `>` and `<` relational operators;
+ Repetition (`for` loop).

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

#Challenges
+ "Low rating" - Use of `if` statement and `<` relational operator to show a cross or a sad face if the rating is under 25.
+ "More animations" - Use of a `for` loop to create more animations.
