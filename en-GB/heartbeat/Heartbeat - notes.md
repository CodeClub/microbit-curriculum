title: Heartbeat â€” Notes for Club Leaders
---

#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to use the Bluetooth radio in the micro:bit, by making a simple heartbeat monitor. Pressing the buttons on the micro:bit will change the image that's displayed.

#Resources
For this project, the [MakeCode (PXT)](http://jumpto.cc/pxt-new) microbit editor should be used.

You can find a completed version of this project at [makecode.microbit.org/_0cT0je2sL0o7](https://makecode.microbit.org/_0cT0je2sL0o7), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ microbit-Heartbeat.hex

#Learning Objectives
+ Radio blocks

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

#Challenges
+ "Fall detector" - show that multiple messages can be sent that cause different beaviours.
+ "No heartbeat detected" - extend project with features that would exist in a real device.
